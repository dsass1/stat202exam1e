## Application (15 points)

*Failure to use functions taught in class and opting for base R or AI solutions will result in automatic deductions from each application in which it is used.*

<br>

The following applications use the `survey` dataset which has been pre-loaded for you. All necessary libraries have been pre-loaded for you.

This contains the responses to the questions asked the first day of class to students taking STAT202 at NU. For a detailed description of the variables and data click the Section titled "survey Data". You are welcome to use the Help feature of Posit Cloud if needed.

For each application **only output/print the requested information**. If you are outputting miscellaneous information there will be a deduction.

<br>

Don't forget to click **Submit**. I recommend using **Submit** rather than "Run", that way you don't forget. You must submit every **code chunk**.

### Application 1 (1 points)

Load the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` package.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r App1-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

*All applications will still run even if this is incorrect.*

### Application 2 (5 points)

Construct a scatterplot of `followers_insta` by `height_inches`. Set the `color` equal to `personality`.

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = height_inches, y = followers_insta, color = personality)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

In **one sentence** describe the relationship between a student's height and the number of follower on Instagram. In **one sentence** state why you are or are not surprised by this relationship.

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 6)
```



### Application 3 (4 points)

For First year students, let's determine if there is a difference in the distribution of followers on Instagram for introverts and extroverts.

In other words,

- start with the `survey` data
- include only students that have a `school_year` of "First year"
- compute the mean, standard deviation, and count of `followers_insta` by `personality`
- print/output the results with the lowest mean on top

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
survey %>%
  filter(school_year == "First year") %>%
  group_by(personality) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(followers_insta, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(followers_insta, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n()) %>%
  arrange(mean)
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

### Application 4 (5 points)

Construct a histogram of `followers_insta`. Facet the histogram based on `personality`. Choose an appropriate number of bins AND have it defined in code. Change the border color to "white".

```{r App4, exercise=TRUE}


```

```{r App4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = followers_insta)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 30)+
  facet_wrap(~ personality)
```

```{r App4-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "submitted",
  incorrect = "submitted"
)
```

Describe and compare the histogram.

```{r App4-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 10)
```

## survey Data

You are welcome to open the dataset in Posit Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

Variables:

- `quarter` -- Identifies in which quarter the student took stat 202 (winter 2023, fall 2022, summer 2022, spring 2022, winter 2022, fall 2021)
- `gender_ident` -- "Which gender do you identify as (Male, Female). "Other" was removed to protect against the possibility of having their responses identified by other students.""
- `school_year` -- "What year are you in school? (First year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Other)"
- `num_party` -- "On average (approx.) how many parties a month do you attend?"
- `personality` -- "Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? (Introvert, Extrovert)"
- `height_inches` -- "How tall are you? (in inches)"
- `happy` -- "How happy are you? (Very happy, Pretty happy, Not too happy, Don't know)"
- `campus_housing` -- "Where do you live on campus? (North campus, South campus, Neither)"
- `followers_insta` -- "How many followers do you have on Instagram (approx.)?""
- `followers_tiktok` -- "How many followers do you have on TikTok (approx.)?""
- `salary` -- "What do you expect your starting salary to be after graduation, to the nearest thousand dollars? (ex: 47,000)"
